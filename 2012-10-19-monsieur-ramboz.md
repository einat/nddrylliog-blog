### Intro

Writing a follow-up to my last interesting blog post, [A Quiet Panic][aqp],
is no easy task. It covered a lot of ground, and overall generated a good
amount of feeedback.

However, I don't see myself stopping here. It was only an approximate dump of
my brain at a point in time. It is by no mean comprehensive, and arguably hard
to follow. In any case, it is a pessimistic viewpoint, and I do not feel
comfortable leaving it at that.

Last Wednesday, Frederic and I hosted one of our [thebootstrap][tbp] meetings at
our place. The usual crew attended, plus [Michele][pirroh] but instead of
hacking for a few hours, we had a long discussion. A broad one.

[tbp]: http://thebootstrap.ch/
[pirroh]: https://twitter.com/pirroh

The starting point was whether or not to import the "Hackers at Berkeley"
initiative here in Lausanne. Michele expressed his intent to give young people
(18 and older) the motivation to acquire the tools required to build software.

When asked about my opinion on the subject, I replied that it was a great
initiative and that I was all for it, but that nowadays my main concern was not
about pure technology, as it seems to be, in practice, only a vessel for young
souls to fall into the hands of corporations rather than an instrument of change
in the world. Nowadays, my main concern is providing people with the tools
required to apply critical thinking to any and all areas of their life.

The discussion then drifted onto more general subjects such as what the driving
forces behind world change are, what shortcomings universities have in yielding
critical thinkers (and, in the case of EPFL, simple programmers...), and what we
could do about it, if we put effort into it.

And at some point came the question: where do you want to be, 10 years from now?
This is not only a mindless interrogation that comes up after a few many beers,
it is - in my opinion - a very important and healthy reality check. Of course,
asking the question is the easy part. When it was my turn to answer, I had,
unfortunately, no idea at all.

### Trading lies for Weltanschauungs

I'll try to summarize here a few interesting points from [A Quiet Panic][aqp]
that I will build upon in this article. First, the evolution of the Internet in
the past 20 years means we have entered in what we'll call the Information age -
where not knowing everything about the world is not caused by a lack of means of
communication, but rather by the impossible difficulty to digest the incredible
quantity of information at our fingertips, much less to qualify it accurately.

Secondly, I redefined the word "lie" as "any assumption made that limits one's
ability to reason about a subject". I took for example teaching that no numbers
smaller than 0 existed in elementary school. So, with my definition, a lie is no
longer "willingly telling something which we know is in direct contradiction
with the truth". The definition I proposed is derived from a subset of a meaning
of "lie", but it is also, in a way, more universal. Because it allows us to
analyze our respective upbringings and beliefs and try to figure out if they
limit our thinking in any way.

Thirdly, I made the assumption (a lie, by definition) that the way the world
works currently is based on regular, regulated, and systematic abuse. I called
that a slow, collective suicide. That was perhaps the darkest part of the
article, and it is perhaps not the most interesting as well. But hopefully I
will come back to that in later publications.

I would like to come back to my redefinition of lie, and trade it for the word
'Weltanschauung'. An approximate English translation would be 'comprehensive
world view'. However, this translation is rather poor, and the concept itself
is better served by a definition. Or rather, several definitions.

According to Humboldt (1767-1835), language is an important part of a specific
Weltanschauung. For example, the lack of subtlety of modern English leads to
confusion, as demonstrated by the history of the notion of 'worldview'.

> Humboldt argued that language was part of the creative adventure of mankind.
> Culture, language and linguistic communities developped simultaneously, he
> argued, and could not do so without one another. In stark contrast to
> linguistic determinism, which invites us to consider language as a constraint,
> a framework or a prison house, Humboldt maintained that speech is inherently
> and implicitly creative. Human beings take their place in speech and continue
> to modify language and thought by their creative exchanges.

-- Wikipedia, [Weltanschauung](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weltanschauung)

When considering language a creative endeavor (which I think it is), one can
conclude that language does not consist of a pure lie (in the sense defined in
AQP). It remains true that the language in which one thinks, writes, and
creates, will definitely impact it. Also, it is also the language that allows
one to reason beyond simple concepts. I can't think of a single great thinker
who only communicated using ideograms! Similarly, the 'lie' of Newtonian physics
still allow to reason about the movement of solid objects up to a certain point.
So, it is creative in itself, and definitely useful.

Hence, one shall not reject lies entirely, by fear of completely abandoning
intelligent thought. Rather, one shall consider lies transient, rather than
definitive. The critical thinker will be apt to jump swiftly from lie to lie,
carefully considering each one and retaining concepts useful to their further
research.

Also, it should be obvious that, even when one would like to reject all lies in
bulk, by the time they reach an age of consciousness sophisticated enough to
even have that intention, education will have done its damages and it will
become impossible to extirpate oneself from the Weltanschauung that was
carefully built by the combination of one's parents, teachers, and social
context in general.

Finally, liberating one's mind from all lies simultaneously is not, in my
opinion, desirable. The human mind is a fragile thing, and jumping from
prethought certainties to absolute agnosticism seems like a surefire way to
reach clinical insanity in record times. Rather than risking that, I would
recommend carefully identifying and preparing the terrain.

It is my opinion that there is no such thing as a single 'thought processor'
that comes up with coherent conclusions. On the contrary, the human brain
appears to work as a college of old, grumpy professors, who all have their very
different opinion and would keep bickering for hours if bodily needs did not put
an end to it. The existence of these conflicts are, however, welcome to the
critical thinker. The ability to compare and confront different ideas and
ideologies are one of the fundamental activities of critical thinking. When
devising questions against an idea (i.e. examining thoroughly, emitting doubts)
is no longer an easy task, comparing it with its alternatives is a fruitful way
to generate more questions.

Another, more complete definition of Weltanschauung came later, courtesy of Leo
Apostel (1925-1995), as the combination of these six elements:

  * An explanation of the world (How does the world work?)
  * A futorology (Where are we heading?)
  * Ethical values (What should we do?)
  * A praxeology (How should we attain our goals?)
  * An epistemology (What is true and false?)
  * An etiology - the study of the origins and influences of a given
    Weltanschauung

From that list, I've been mostly thinking and writing about epistemology and
etiology. This list, however, works as a nice TODO list when trying to reason
about the world as a whole.

Back to the question of a 10-year life goal, I keep finding that I would really
like to encourage people to think. However, before attempting to give lessons, I
need to do some more thinking of my own. Of course, I don't expect the thinking
to ever end as long as my heart beats, but I am willing to at least, try to
remedy to cultural holes in the subjects of History, Philosophy, and prominent
ideologies of the past few centuries.

### Das Kapital

As a first attempt to confront some of my current interrogations with historical
writings of influential thinkers, I have taken interest in the person of Karl
Heinrich Marx (1818-1883). Monsieur Ramboz was one of his nicknames, when
residing in Paris, so that it was harder for the authorities to track him down.

When mentioning Marx, people often think about Marxism, and its totalitarian
derivatives: Leninism, Stalinism, Trotskyism, Maoism, and so on. However, one
must remember that Marxist theory is merely an attempt by Marx's followers to
summarize his writings and is thus, bound to be inaccurate. In reality, Marx's
writings are remarkable both in breadth and depth, but like most influential
thinkers, his work was used to justify the doings of radical movements.

Because of that, when studying the writings of Marx, I will deliberately ignore
the excesses that were derived from it. I will try to limit myself to his
original doctrins. Leaving Marx's prediction of a 'socialist revolution' aside
for a minute, we can note that he has been called "the first great user of the
critical method in social sciences".

Far from simply discarding capitalism, he spent a great amount of time studying
and discussing it.

-- Wikipedia, [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx) (emphasis
mine)

To understand Marx's Weltanschauung, you have to get to know one of the
fundamental lies (in the 'soft' sense of the term I defined above - which is,
both limiting and useful for understanding) underlying his whole body of work.

The basic principle is that the engine for social evolution is economic
activity (which explains why Marx dedicated so much time studying it.) According
to Marx, we can distinguish six distinct stages a society goes through:

  1. Cooperative tribal societies
  2. Slave Society (progression from a tribal system to city-states)
  3. Feudalism (aristocrats are the ruling class, merchants evolve into
     capitalists)
  4. Capitalism (capitalists are the ruling class, who create and employ the
     proletariat)
  5. Socialism (dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is replaced with the
     dictatorship of the proletariat)
  6. Communism (a classless and stateless society)

Karl Marx made many interesting observations about capitalism: again, he wasn't
only negative in his discussions, but also recognized that capitalism was (and
apparently, still is) one of the most revolutionary stages, in terms of
technical progress and development.

### Capitalism, spirituality, and means of control

On the negative side, Marx denounced many perverse effects of capitalism, among
which Alienation is the most striking to me:

> Alienation denotes the estrangement of people from their humanity (German:
> Gattungswesen, “species-essence”, “species-being”), which is a systematic
> result of capitalism. Under capitalism, the fruits of production belong to the
> employers, who expropriate the surplus created by others, and so generate
> alienated labourers. Alienation objectively describes the worker’s situation
> in capitalism — his or her self-awareness of this condition is not
> prerequisite.

-- Wikipedia, [Marxism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism)

> For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own
> labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated
> from one's own nature; it is a spiritual loss.

-- Wikipedia, [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx)

Marx (and Engels) go on to describe "ideologies" as means of control a class has
over another class. Lower classes tend to consider ideologies timeless and
universal, whereas upon studying the bigger picture, one finds that ideologies
were easily traded one for the other, depending on the interests of the ruling
class. Marx goes even further, in what may be one of his most well-known quotes
about religion:

> Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real
> suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the
> oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless
> conditions. It is the opium of the people.
>
> The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the
> demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions
> about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires
> illusions.

-- Karl Marx, Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right

### A few steps back

We have only grazed the surface of the work of Marx - and the excerpts I have
selected and summarized probably have their inaccuracies and biases as well. But
let's nevertheless try and have a few reflections of our own on what I just
quoted above.

First, the point that was just made about ideologies (of which religions are
just instances, in Marx's thought system) introduces an interesting addition to
my redefinition of lies. When covering the 'weave of lies' everyone had to deal
with when trying to think for himself or herself, I assumed that most of the
lies were transmitted 'accidentally', because of cultural context and sincere
beliefs from the part of parents, teachers, etc.

However, it seems likely that ideologies are in fact used as weapons from one
class to the other (I am reluctant to use Marx's nomenclature here, as dividing
the world into classes is just one way to analyze it, but let's bear with it for
a moment.) in order to keep lower classes in control.

I find this very interesting. But I want to add a thought of my own to this: I
think that technological progress has deprecated ideologies as a primary mean of
controlling lower classes, leaving place to comfort. Come to think of it, up to
a certain point of technological advances, it was simply not possible to provide
the proletariat with comfort: the nature of their labour (farming, mining, etc.)
was intrinsincally uncomfortable. It had direct impact on their health and
lifestyles, required long hours to operate, etc.

However, particularly in the Western world, we have seen well after Marx's
death, the realization of the Theory of progression:

> Economies tend to follow a developmental progression that takes them from a
> heavy reliance on agriculture and mining, toward the development of
> manufacturing (e.g. automobiles, textiles, shipbuilding, steel) and finally
> toward a more service-based structure. The first economy to follow this path
> in the modern world was the United Kingdom. The speed at which other economies
> have made the transition to service-based (or "post-industrial") economies has
> increased over time.

-- Wikipedia, [Tertiary sector of the
economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy)

Interestingly, one can remark that the Theory of progression leads to a world
crisis. Indeed, when all economies evolve into service-based economies, who will
take care of the primary (exploitation) and secondary (industrial) sectors?
Even more interestingly, this might explain why western countries are not too
eager to see less developed countries evolve out of the primary and secondary
sectors. But I digress.

My point is, following the Theory of progress, western economies have evolved
from tough, manual labor, to a service-based economy with mostly 9-to-5 desk
jobs. In that new context, powerful ideologies are no longer necessary to keep
the working class in ranks. In fact, the rise of secularism has in no way
disturbed the distinction between the ruling class and the working class.

Contrarily to Marx's expectations, syndicates have managed to obtain salary
raises, along with several important improvements to workers' conditions. With
the development of technology, it is no longer necessary to impose such appalling
working conditions to accumulate wealth.

All this brings me back to one of my earliest conclusions about the lack of any
significant changes: comfort is the deadly enemy of both critical thought and
revolutionary action, much more than ideologies.

### Nineteen Eighty-four

In my mind, comfort (composed, in part, of consumerism) is the most effective
exploitation tool ever devised. Much more, for example, than a police state.

Orwell's novel, 1984, seems to continuously wake individuals up to the idea that
some societal changes are happening, and that they are not necessary headed in
the right direction. In general, it gets people worrying, and it's now used
regularly to discuss various law projects, or methods used by governments, both
Western and Eastern.

However, it is my belief that, even though one should remain alert and fight
against the invasions against privacy that governments seem to be fond of, the
emergence of a police state is not the worse we have to fear.

In a way, the worst has already happened. The worst is not the lack of freedom
of expression, it's not censorship or repression in anyway, it's not the
emprisonment of dissidents, it's not a totalitarian regime. When all these
afflictions happen, it has the opposite effect on people: rather than erasing
all signs of rebellion, it pushes everyone to think for themselves and rise up
for what is just and desirable.

On the contrary, in the Western world, we have been able to witness a process of
pacification of the population, leading to an intellectual and social paralysis,
and accompanied with a global depression, easily demonstrated by the
increasingly nihilist cultural developments.

Leaving freedom of speech but neutering critical thinking is such a cruel thing
to do to human beings. Places of free expression such as Reddit and 4chan are
typical recipients for the confusion and despair of the young generation. We can
see a consistent oscillation between entertainment - jokes, games, music, films,
porn, and expression of ill-being (bullying, obscenity, violence, suicidal
thoughts).

### On the subject of praxeology

Praxeology asks the question "how do we attain our goals?". If we start from the
observation that one important problem is that most people are not thinking (at
all), then our goal could be to get them to think. However, there is little
incentive for them to do so. So, how do we get people to think?

Waking up this generation is going to be hard. In comparison, brewing a
rebellion among miners is achieved relatively easily - by simply pointing out
their conditions of life, and comparing them with those of the ruling class.

However, pointing out those differences now is more difficult - in appearance,
the working class has access to most of what the ruling class has. The working
class has cars, internet, coffee and alcohol. It has washing machines, bikes,
balconies and healthcare. One could almost confuse those classes if they forgot
about the defining characteristic of the bourgeoisie: to own the means of
production. Actually, in modern economies, "owning the means of productions" is
less significant than it was in 1850, but the intention remains the same: the
bourgeoisie owns the conduits by which value is exchanged.

Not only is making the distinction between the working class and the bourgeoisie
harder in 2012 than it was in the 1800s, it is also harder to emphasize the
negative aspects of the current system. It is not uncommon to encounter
employees who think, in all sincerity, that the current system is satisfactory.
That they have no interest in being involved in running the world, or even a
small part of it, and neither do they have the interest or patience to even try
to understand how it works.

Marx did most of his work because he wanted to have an impact on the world. And
he wanted to have an impact on the world because he was unhappy with how things
were going. But what can you do when the majority is relatively satisfied with
how things are going?

### Capitalism as a hindrance to technological progress

One of the reasons I am unhappy with how the world is going, as a technologist,
is because I believe technology (note: not the state of research, but the amount
of discoveries we use in production around the world) has reached a state where
it would be harmless for capitalism to encourage it more.

Marx recognized capitalism as an engine of technological progress, but that was
in the 1850s. My belief is that technology has evolved to the point where it
stroke just the right balance between a) improving productivity, b) providing
comfort to the working class c) retaining the need for a working class.

My intuition is that if technological progresses were completely free of
corporate interference, the progress of Earth's inhabitants as a race would be
phenomenal. We would find efficient ways to harness all our discoveries and
eliminate the need for human exploitation.

But my intuition also tells me that this is not going to happen in a lifetime.
When looking at the different stages Marx draws over the course of history
(Tribal / Primitive, City-state / Slavery, Empire / Feudal, Countries /
Capitalism), at least those that actually happened, there is *always* human
exploitation - always an upper class and a lower class, no matter what they are
called. It seems that it is part of human nature to exploit one another, even
when there is technically no need to do so to appropriately benefit from natural
resources or to survive - better, live - together as human beings.

Is capitalism the final stage of human civilization? No. Is communism (or
socialism) the next logical step? Probably not. It is my belief that if Marx had
lived through to see the two World Wars and the incredible apathy of the modern
world, he would have recognized the idealism of "The Communist Manifesto" as
naive and, honestly, Rousseau-esque. It's a shame his followers didn't apply
the critical method themselves.
