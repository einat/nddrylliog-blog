I was recently discussing start-ups with a group of friends during a hackup,
when one of them asked me: "So what about you? Are you going to stay at
Official.fm?"

### Preaching to the choir

I have been notoriously blabby about start-ups on this blog: from [advice to recruiters][nagging]
to [advice to job-seekers][job-offers], opinions about [business ethics][winning], and even
a piece [on the proper usage of jerks][jerks]. Heck, I even launched a [support net for entrepreneurs][tbs]
in Switzerland.
