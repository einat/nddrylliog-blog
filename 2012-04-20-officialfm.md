I was recently discussing start-ups with a group of friends during a hackup,
when one of them asked me: "So what about you? Are you going to stay at
Official.fm?"

### Preaching to the choir

I have been notoriously blabby about start-ups on this blog: from [advice to recruiters][nagging]
to [advice to job-seekers][job-offers], opinions about [business ethics][winning], and even
a piece [on the proper usage of jerks][jerks]. Heck, I even launched a [support net for entrepreneurs][tbs]
in Switzerland.

Little has been said about official.fm online. I remember when I first started recruiting for
it, one dude asked me if we were a real company. I had to send a proof of existence to convince
him to take the job! Those were funny days.

### What I've been doing there

My first job at official.fm was to create bindings for our API, along with demo applications.
I've always loved to dabble into new languages, so much that I even [created my own][ooc].

Then, I got the incredible chance to assemble [a team of audio hackers][ofmlabs]. Together, we
created [audio decoders in JavaScript][codecs], and even whipped up entire products under the
radar. We operated on our own servers, moving fast, learning tons of stuff. Our work took us
to Berlin (jsconf.eu), to [Dublin][dublin], to Geneva, for team meet-ups.

I have since left the labs team to the good care of [Jussi][jussi], to move on closer to the
product. I've had a chance to better understand the challenges of the core development team,
help with the implementation of key features, and participate to the recruiting process.

Oh, and did I mention that all along I've been doing studies at [EPFL][epfl], maintaining
several open-source projects and participating to events like [Ludum Dare][ld]?

### Room for talent

As you can see, there was little time left to be bored. Official.fm is still relatively young:
it was founded in August 2010, and at the time of this writing, is counting about
twenty employees now, working from Geneva, New York, San Francisco and Paris.
