### But it's proprietary!

Well yeah. But it's really convenient. It's really fast (for me), it has filters
and tags, and all the other alternatives I've tried, like roundcube, don't even

come close.

I don't feel like using Gmail is restricting my freedom. I can redirect mail to Gmail,
from Gmail to the outside world, forward, receive, and respond to anything. Besides,
the Android app is way better than stock e-mail.

Besides, we use it [at work](http://official.fm). It just feels like the best tool for the job

### Why  not write a client yourself?

Well I'd love to, if I ever find the time. Unfortunately, pretty much everything
about e-mail sucks, similary to how pretty much everything about
$blog/BitTorrent[BitTorrent] rocks.

I'm not a fan of POP3, and IMAP looks complicated - in any case you have to store
everything on your own server because it's way too slow - but that's not all, you
also have to cache it client-side, which requires a whole framework just to get right.

In my opinion, Google nailed it and it would take more than a week-end to build
something up to the task.

### If you do write one, let me know!

Will do! Drop me a line at [amos@official.fm](mailto:amos@official.fm) if you're interested.
