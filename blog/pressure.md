# Understanding the effects of pressure

Often family and friends don't understand this apparent paradox: how can I tell them that I have no free time this week, and still spend hours playing video games? At first sight, this makes me a lazy slob with poor excuses for avoiding his loved ones. However, it is one of the numerous phenomenons that have well-defined causes and that you just have to accept.

## How the internet ruined everything

The internet age has changed everything about the way we work. Old people like to blather snarky remarks like: "Back in the days, you could wait a whole week for mail to arrive". Nowadays, you can ping someone on Twitter and get a meaningful answer in a few seconds.

Back in the days, people had to allocate timeslices on huge, costly workstations ten times the size of your bedroom just to have computations done. Now almost all home computers stay idle, waiting for user input. Idling, sleeping and various standby modes have become so important that it's one of the main reason the Android developers added custom interfaces to the Linux kernel!

Back in the days, you could wait twenty hours for a compile to finish: and in some areas, this is still true (console game development, for example). However, in web development, often the moment between saving a file and seeing the results is less than a second. How does that impact us developers?

Having near-instantaneous feedback on what we build radically changes the way it is conceived. When you're building a 100-feet tower out of wood sticks, you cannot just "throw it together quickly and see if it holds". However, in web, this is what we do everyday, because it's much cheaper than working months in the wrong direction.

As a result, young programmers that were bathed in that web culture have a general tendency (which thankfully doesn't apply to everyone - as does every generalization) to lack planning abilities, in exchange for a stunning propension to adapt quickly to any adversity the real world might throw at them.

An older friend of mine is still in that old mindset of laying everything down first. When tackling a problem, he thinks like he is building a 100-feet tower. He considers every possible angle, draws figures, has a good long think. And finally when he decides to start coding, he's done in a few hours and often it works the first time!

## An extreme lifestyle

That saids, would I want to employ this old friend to work on web projects? No. Because the way business works on the internet, you don't have the time to plan everything in advance. And the real world throws a lot of shit at you, and you better react fast.
