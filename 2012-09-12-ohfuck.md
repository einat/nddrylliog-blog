### Intro

A few weeks ago, I discovered [goodfil.ms][gf]. It started with [this article][gfm].

[gf]: http://goodfil.ms

Oh, fuck. There's a beautiful movie website out there, built in 2011, with a
gorgeous design, a great domain name, and their mobile app is out. With the added
luxury of a multipart technical article on how they used AngularJS to go mobile.

And now [they integrate nicely with Netflix][gfn]. And they get social right. And
they already link movie pages to Wikipedia. And they allow user reviews. And they
show you what your friends are reviewing.

The only thing it's missing is proper movie recommendation. A little partnership with
[Foundd][fdd], and that's a done thing.

They're based in Melbourne, are just two guys, seem to get along great, were previously
at [Envato][envato], and have already closed a round of angel funding to develop their
product.

Oh, fuck.

### Main piece

At this point, I should probably write a few paragraphs of motivatese, about how
giving up is weak, about how different websites can strive in the same area. But
I'm tired of it. I think goodfil.ms has won not one battle, but the whole war.

Time to pivot. Or go back to bed.
