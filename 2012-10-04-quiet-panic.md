### Preface

It's not with pleasure that I'm starting to write this blog post.
For all I know, it's only doing me disservice, and I know that it won't
raise the spirits of its readers. So, I want to apologize in advance, for
what I'm about to write. Please be aware that the real world might not
be so grim, and that all this might just be the product of a latent
depression.

Nevertheless, I am feeling a kind of quiet pressure, a silent urgency,
to write down some of my thoughts as of late, so that perhaps I will be
able to move on to other things. Everything is still confused, as I've
been experiencing a severe drop in intellectual abilities for the past
few years, but I'll try to lay it out in a useful fashion.

### Roots

Whenever we try to describe a situation, it is always a good idea to
paint the boundaries, to situate it both in time and space. I was born
in 1990, in Saint-Julien en Genevois, a city of Haute-Savoie (74), in France.

Newborn, I had no knowledge of the fall of the Berlin Wall, the election
of president Gorbachev, or any of that. I was born in a house that cared less
for the fate of the world and its politics, than that of the family itself.
That was both a blessing and a curse, as I showed very little interest in
History and Geography courses during primary school, which I now regret.

I do not remember much of my first fourteen years, but according to my
parents, I was sick a lot. So, it is good to know that my peculiar sleeping
schedule is nothing new. The difference being that back then, I had an
actual, physical reason to be kept up: a deep, painful, resistant, high
fever on and off for seven years.

Nowadays, physical illness is less of a concern, although I what is
commonly called "regular nights" are still the exception. The sickness is
more mental than it is physical. I have spent some time studying medical
resources to find out if any particular mental illness applied to me, but
- apart from the fact that self-diagnostic is a very bad idea - my conclusion
was that either I was doing fine, or that everyone was insane. Which is
the same, really.

From what I remember of my childhood, I was a terrible kid. I can't recall
a single adult whose words I have not argumented against, whose authority
I have not questioned. This may come as a shocker, when you realize that
my family was, at the time, rather conservative. Hence, well before
my teens, it seemed like I did not belong here. The amount of hatred and
sorrow that was generated because of my bravades to my parents, teachers,
and preachers is hard to measure exactly - what I know is that they do
remember me.

I used to be quite the creative. Only a few friends of mine equal my then
production of music, drawings, writings, blogs, software, games. Not a week
goes by that I am not remembered of an old project of mine that completely
slipped off my mind. Looking back on it, it is certainly impressive - but
for the most part, I've lost records of it, which means trying to make
a comprehensive list would be vain - besides, who I am to deserve such
attention?

Long before taking up programming, I had been experimenting, in different
areas but with the same intent: building stuff. Building arguments against
evolution in primary school, building robots and weird machines using legos
and small electronic motors, trying to help people rebuild their couples,
their lives. Building musical universes, characters, graphical ambiences.
While seemingly diverse, all these activities revolve around the same
obsession. I consumed a lot, but being passive was never really an option.

My theory as to the lack of memories from my childhood, is that I never
actually had one. Not that I have been dropped on earth at 21, but it feels
more like having lived several separate lifes in sequence. Apart from a few
superficial character traits, I was just as adult as the 16-year old author
of the blog 'What True Love Is' than I am now, at least in my head.

Writing about myself is a difficult exercise, because I am constantly
pestered about considerations of self-worth: do I deserve to be a subject
of study? The same goes about enriching my vocabulary. Who do I think I am?
And the use of first-person pronouns. It is a painful effort to force
myself to write these paragraphs, but I set out to do it.

That conscience - that perhaps humility is something I needed to learn -
came very late. No trick in my youth, either from my teachers or parents,
actually broke me. I never truly broke down before authority, admitting
my faults and pledging to be humbler from then on. No. The realization
happened much later, and had a significant impact.

I have written a lot about my previous romantic relationships, so I will
not go into details here, but there are two worth nothing, because of how
catastrophic they were. The first one marked the end of my ascension as a
know-it-all, self-righteous, invincible tall rascal.

The first true love leaves an eternal mark - or so they say. Who can tell,
now, if it was true love, or if I should use that other word conveniently
manufactured for it: 'codependency'? Fortunately, in these days there are
words to denature almost anything. And by 'denature' I mean 'get over', of
course.

Regardless, at the time I did believe it was true love. Just like I believed
that the Bible was the word of an eternal, all-powerful, everloving, just,
creator, commander of armies, forgiving but vengeful, father, spirit and son,
God. It used to all fit together so nicely. Nevermind that my parents 
disapproved of our premarital sex - in my vision, marriage was nothing more
than the union of two bodies and souls, as the Bible described. The rest was
administrative shenanigans.

It lasted quite some time - and during that time, I have made myself a fool
on more than one occasion. I have looked at suicide in the face, both in the
person of my now ex-fianc√©e, and later, myself. That said, I was glad to
go through all of that. A bloody bathtub is not exactly a happy scene, but
when it is all you have, even a mental hospital's bedroom can feel like
home. I have learned to love blood, and to fear its power. I have learned
patience and forgiveness, tolerance and open-mindedness.

But the bulk of the life lessons came after the break-up. Getting out of
a weave of lies is not that easy. I was not ready to let go of it. I had
expelled from my life almost all my old friends and family. I had refused
to pursue any activity that did not fit in that perfect ideal of a couple.
The end of it was simply inconceivable to me. It meant that all that we had
been building towards simply wasn't anymore. I did not exist outside of her,
because my life had been a function of her - outside of this couple, it was
simply undefined.

I did manage to put aside the option to kill myself then, for two reasons.
The first one was that while being this self-righteous asshole, a few people
had come to depend on me for counselling and support. After having vigorously
advocated against suicide for a long time, I could not betray my legacy
and bring them down with me. The second one is a bargain I made with a friend.
"You are young, there's so much left to live. Just try it for six months,
we'll talk then if you still want to." And sure enough, a few months later
I did find enough interest in life again that death seemed again only a
distant prospect.

There was simply too much to learn, too much to do. As far as I can remember,
I have never been satisfied with half-assed explanations, I always wanted
to know exactly the how and the why. That curiosity brought me far enough
to be able to play the instruments I like, to create the games I can imagine,
to put together web services for the purposes I conceive. But recently,
my curiosity has gotten the better of me.

### Cycles

I did not stop learning, looking for information, always more. I think that
all our fears related to the internet have come true already. It did bring out
both the best and the worst of people - like any powerful tool. It did wield
significant social and politic change. It did bring closer people, and it drew
further apart other people. It is under attack from all the ancient industries
so that they can regulate it and deform it for their own purpose rather than
adapting their business to it.

But most importantly, the amount of information at our finger-tips has
caught up to us, and today more than ever, the threat of decisional immobility
is upon us. Most - no, all - lives are deeply rooted into diverse weaves of
lies. Religions and politics are among the most popular and the best documented,
but they are far from the only ones. Truth is, the world is much too much for
a single human being. And for that very reason, parents continually try to hide,
filter, reformat reality so that their children grow into functional beings.

To the question: can we ever have too much knowledge? I will answer: yes and no.
No, because every child is originally thirsty for knowledge, and I believe that
in a proper environment that encourages experimentation and learning, that thirst
is never quite quenched, if only because the next oasis is systematically hinted
at, in every lesson. Yes, because I've found "ignorance is bliss" to be
particularly true, especially in 2012.

Lies are very easy to spot even in primary school. My favorite one when I was
a teen, was that there were no numbers smaller than 0. Then, that there was no
number between -2 and -3. Then, that there was no number such that, squared, it
would give -1. And so on. Those are little lies, and relatively harmless, perhaps
necessary to a proper, progressive instruction of algebra, but they shocked
me as particularly blatant and admitted, and they set a precedent.

If a group of adults, responsible for our education, supposedly put in place by
God - or at least, by the authorities (later, we will blame the "system"), were
so readily willing to lie to us on these matters, what other large-scale lies
could there be? However silly, it remains to me the archetypal lie on which I
have based my further studies on the subject.

Of course, at this point, we need to define what actually a "lie" is. The Westminster
catechism is of little help here, as western notions of truthood and falsehood
rarely apply outside of boolean logic. No, in my mind, a lie is simply a boundary
put in place to form an "education". An education is something that limits,
that bounds, your life. (As opposed to an "instruction", which expands its scope).

So, by definition, a lie is anything that limits your thoughts or your actions.
For example, if I could make you believe a lie stating that "France was always
a republic", then you would never even think of studying the history of Louis XIV.
If I could make you believe a lie stating that France is still a republic, you
would not even think of doubting and investigating the actions of big corporations
in the country.

One might object that this definition of a lie is a bit silly, as it would make
"believing that demons do not exist" or "believing that stars do not predict our
behavior" lies themselves. Well, I am willing to take the fall for those - every
silly superstition out there is actually an interesting subject of study, if only
so that we can find evidence against it.

Even purely imaginary constructs are subjects of interest - they develop new
ways of thinking, therefore expanding your intellectual abilities. For example,
it's your right to believe that complex numbers do not exist, but their utility
have been proven time and again, for example when analyzing electronic circuits,
which are very much real. It's also your right to doubt the existence of God,
but he has also been proven very useful in real life, to control immense crowds
of people - or even just to calm down a single individual.

Our definition of "lie" leaves us embarassed when we have to come back to what
"truth" means. If a truth was the opposite of a lie, then by definition a truth
would be anything that expands your mind and life. But some truths are incompatible.
If you accept the linearity of time, and principle of identity, something either
is or isn't - therefore, one of these statements: "X exists" and "X doesn't exist"
must be a truth, and the other one must be a lie.

That's all good and fancy when only two truthlies are fighting. But what about a
thousand truthlies, all subtly different and contradictory, all with
significant followings? How do you distinguish between the true truths and the
true lies then? That is the kind of conundrum we find ourselves into, in the
Information era.

Of course, supporters of "the scientific method" will have jumped at my throat
at least half a dozen times already. Truth is backed by facts - facts are found
either by induction or deduction. Either by experiments, theorization, and
verifications, or generated by a system of logic rules - themselves designed
to generate more, complex rules.

The problem is that, with our (my) definition of a lie, the whole scientific
method is a lie. In the case of induction, you start out with observations, then
try to figure out a rule that explains what you see - again, the scientific method.
Then you try to verify your theory by varying slightly the experiments, reproducing
it under different conditions. Assuming your measure are accurate, you should
be able to show (I'm reluctant to use the word 'prove') the validity of your model.

But the question yields: how comprehensive is your model? As far as we knew, Newtonian 
physics explained most of what we could observe up to a certain point. Then came
more precise instruments of measures - vessels of truth, that exposed phenomenons
that could no longer be explained by the current models. So, new models had to be
devised, to attempt to explain the very big and the very tiny. But no matter
how sophisticated, no model can take into account the progress of instruments of
measure, no model can guarantee to explain all the discoveries still to be made.
Hence, all models are lies - because they restrict one's vision and thought system
to a set of rules that were devised to explain and operate with a certain,
limited set of observations. In the same way that my first break-up caused me
to reconsider my model of romantic relationships, which simply did not include
the eventuality of the end.

Deduction is even worse. It can only occur when you work from a set of axioms.
Not even observations, just arbitrary statements that you've chosen as valid.
So, the entirety of mathematics is a lie - even though some of it can be seen
reflected in nature, it all still stems from a few axioms, and as such, they
restrict our way of thinking - it is all constrained by our numbering system,
our ways to study variations as functions of variables, to study differentials,
and so on. Deduction is rotten to the core, because even though a fixed set of
axioms can yield an infinite number of theorems, they are still limited by
their roots.

And now you might begin to understand why I have been blogging about languages
recently. Every language is inductive: we see things, phenomenons, and we want
to be able to talk about it. Meta-language is how we describe the language
(verbs, adjectives - all these words are part of the vocabulary of meta-language),
but in a way, language itself is meta, it's meta-observations, because it's a
way to describe something that is, essentially, unspoken. Like a sunset, or
sadness. And thus, every language is a lie, because it severely restricts one's
ability - not only to express themselves, but also to think. The fact that I
am writing this post in English is a pain, because of my lack of fluency in
this language, but also because I would like to discuss things that English
is poorly suited for.

Fortunately, language evolves in a much smoother way than science or religion
does: open-minded people do not shy away from inventing new words or deforming
existing ones to try and describe what they've been feeling or experimenting.
Inventing new words is the inductive approach - but defining your new words
requires a deductive approach, where you have to combine existing words to
try and express what you are explaining.

### A few steps back

This post is already getting long, and if you have been following me diligently,
along with shaking your head regularly, you will realize just how deep this
whole reflection goes. I think what I am trying to indirectly express by writing
these few lines, is how incredibly sad I have become - and how my curiosity
and thirst for knowledge is the root cause of my affliction.

I daresay that only a few people can share my burden of over-awareness, simply
because of the reasons listed above: all lives are rooted into a weave of lies
restricting their plane of existence. It even gets more instutionalized when
you graduate from childhood: the simple fact that the word 'expert' exists
signifies that we have been classifying people by worries. Some will worry
about environmental consequences of our industrial habits. Some will worry
about the proper political artifacts to be used for the ruling of our nations.
And some will worry about preserving the litterature of the past centuries,
so that we do not forget where we come from.

And the result, as sad as it is disastrous, is that almost everyone is blind.
Because their vision has to be focused in order to function, they are willingly
deprived from a global vision. Even on a small scale, like the design of a CPU.
It is said of the Intel Pentium II that it was one of the first CPUs to be 
complex enough so that no single person could overview its whole assembly process.
In order to build complex things, there has to be separation of concerns, simply
because of the limitations of the human brain. Complex systems are built as
a cooperation between smaller, simpler systems. And this has worked out pretty
well for the last few centuries.

We often look back to great minds of the last centuries, and celebrate their
production, often their writings. Yet, we are having a hard time identifying
the great minds among us. The only example I could come up with is Elon Musk,
and even his scope seems pretty limited (electric cars, space travel, payment
processors). The truth is, in the 1800s, it was much easier to have a comprehensive
grasp of the world, because it was less diverse - or rather, it was easier
to have the impression that your understanding was comprehensive, because the
amount of information that got to you was more limited. European savants hadn't
the first idea what was happening in arabic countries, yet they are remembered
as almost omniscient gods.

But times have changed. Not only have many constructs been built - both physical,
social, but also theoritical, but the means to spread information have become
severl order of magnitudes more effective. Wikipedia is the go-to example of
something the people in the 1800s would have killed for. It is, in my opinion,
one of the many reasons why we can't seem to produce omniscient geniuses anymore:
the scope, the immensity of the task to undertake to understand the world is
just so impressive that it is simply scary.

Another major reason is the shift in education (which - according to our earlier
definitions, is the wrong word. In reality, it is a mix of education and instruction,
of lies and truths). Even recently, what we call "critical thinking" and
"creativity" was encouraged, rewarded even, instead of being punished. The demands
of the job market today have drawn schools to become specialization nests,
more employee factories than human being forges. Higher education (universities)
defend themselves from that premise, but having spent the last few years there,
I have only observed that they are following the trend just like the other stages
of education/instruction.

For these two reasons (the frightening scope, and the upbringing) and man others,
we don't see generalists rising up anymore. And in my own, little way, in this
post and others, I am trying to go against the flow. I am trying to open myself
up to reflections of ridiculous scale, of thought experiments way over my head,
writing posts that sound incredibly pretentious, just because I cannot seem to
find anyone else doing is who is less of a lunatic than me.

### Suicide - again

The whole motivation for this article stemmed from the idea that the current
world lives on abuse and, on a large scale, collective and individual suicide.
Suicide is not only the brutal outing you can read about in the newspapers, it
is also the slow self-deprecation that society and invididuals, are undergoing.

It is not always the flamboyant departure by pills or gunshot or building jump.
It is also the slow suicide by regular usage of drugs, by body abuse - using
sports, work, and everything that allows to repel boundaries, by mind abuse -
by excess consumption of information without the proper time to absorb it and
reflect on it. It is a very global and conscious process that I think affects
everyone.

Basing an analysis of the world on that premise is scary, but enlightening.
You'll unmistakbly find that a very large number of constructs are institutions
put in place to regulate, or 'manage', 'make bearable', the constant abuse that
human beings inflict on each other.

Instead of cooperating sanely in order to fairly exploit natural resources
to our advantage (which would be another form of abuse - but at least not
inter-human), humans have found it fitter to exploit one another, and have kept
busy building constructs to manage and perhaps legitimize that exploitation.

Companies, both small and big, in their current forms, are not much more than
legitimized and managed exploitation. Of course, the grandiloquent visions of
totalitarism described in ouvrages such as Orwell's 1984 have fallen into desuetude,
because a 'softer' approach has proven much more efficient - an evolution
well documented by Huxley in his essay "Brave New World Revisited".

In the same way that most mainstream religions try to be 'compatible' with
mainstream lifestyles, abuse systems try to be as lenient as possible (while
retaining the advantages of exploiting other human beings) in order to limit
the collateral damage of having to manage revolts.

The general sentiment in our upbringing is to "keep calm", to respect institutions
and to try and find our place in them. The only opposition you will find to
this blind obedience is unfortunately led by short-sighted and unorganized
monkeys, who fall into the inverse trap: systematically opposing to anything that
is popular. In short, there is not much good to be found on either side.

We handle genius and mental illness the same way - it is d'ailleurs often said
that they are related. By using drugs, by segregating different people and
putting them into well-bounded subsystems, we are able to keep the greater
machine running.

I am not fond of describing the errands this world is going through, because
they seem self-evident. The economical suicide committed in the name of greed.
The violations of the spirit of technological progress in order to squeeze in
a few more profits. The social suicide committed by denying the existence of
mental troubles typical of the information age - or, the equally harmful
abusive labelling of any kind of behavior.

In layman terms, you could summarize this section as "I am under the impression
that nobody knows what the fuck they are doing." No matter how vast and
intricate your own personal weave of lies is, if you go the trouble of
expanding your thought system, you'll find areas outside your regular plane
of existence that will baffle you and leave you defenseless.

For most people, this happens in the face of death. Either their own, impending
demise, or those of their close ones. When faced with death, one is forced
to get out of their comfortable plane and consider, even for a short moment,
the immensity of what our existence truly is. That is why I find death so
fascinating. And that is what, I think, many adolescents are trying to
express, even though most of them are too obstructed by lies to be able
to formulate it clearly.

### Epilogue

For the time being, I am still part of this earth and giving it a glacial
stare, trying to understand more and more of what it is about, but I do not
think that this time here will amount for much. I expect to die from a
heart attack or something similar, and I fully acknowledge the fact that,
whatever the age, I will not have found the time to correctly explain just
exactly what was going on in my head.

But I will have tried - and this is just one of the many attempts.
