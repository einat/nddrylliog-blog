### Done cruising

Hi! If you can read this, you are in the 30% of the world population who has
access to the internet. While we can expect that figure to grow, it still ranks
you in the lucky tier. And the downside is that the internet is a comfortable
place.

In first-world countries, it's easy to follow the path most travelled: spend
5 to 8 years working hard for studies, trying to score a job at a big company.
Racking up a yearly 60 to 150K EUR. An apartment, public transportation, or
a car, and so on.

If that's the life you are looking for, nobody can blame you. However, if you
want to follow your own dreams, build an idea from the ground up out of thin
air, my impressions is that the resources are scarce in the neighborhood.

Existing structures seem to misunderstand the basic needs of entrepreneurs,
throwing out impressive budgets in a misguided attempt to cultivate an infertile
ground.

### Done whining

But it is no longer time to complain. How many students are thinking about
dropping out daily? How many don't want to wait another three years to give their
product or service idea a try?

I used to think that the mass of raw information forced upon innocents at
universities had a point: to prepare us for a future in which we would be able
to quickly make informed decisions regarding crucial matters.

As it turns out, I am having more and more doubts about this. The formation
of an engineer prepares him or her to be a specialized gear in a well-oiled
mechanism bigger than him and in which he will always have a limited impact.

This explains why critical thinking is not taught in institutes of Technology.
No ethics, no history, almost no philosophy. In other words: no material to
understand the impact of one's actions in the grander scheme of things.

I believe that every engineer should be a thinking engineer: even the lowest
minion in an organization should have a minimal understanding of how his work
contributes to a greater vision. Otherwise, what is the point of working. And
more importantly: how can we avoid dangerous slopes, if nobody knows what they
are working for?

If engineers are doomed to be tools, and litterary students future teachers
or writers read only by the upper-class, then we are left with perhaps the most
insufferable category of people in higher education: MBAs. Combined with a lack
of technical knowledge, this kind of profit-oriented formation can probably
explain a greater part of the dehumanization of corporations as they grow.

### Gone building

I think we need a new generation of engaged thinkers. Not stuck in ivory towers,
isolated from the real world consequences of their ideas, but on the battleground,
fighting to make their place, to disrupt corrupt industries, to beat down the
competition by proposing a new quality standard, regardless of short-term profits.

And, to a great extent, I think that generation is among us, stuck in dead-end
jobs, in unending study programs, held back by fear and by their immediate
surroundings, craving to find like-minded people to explore new directions with.

Any amount of change takes a huge deal of energy and will to achieve. From painting
a wall, to starting to exercise regularly, to breaking up from an unhealthy
relationship. Dropping out or quitting your job is in the top 5 of "things most
people will advise you against".

But what does it matter? Most people don't change the world. Most people don't
understand what successful businesses are made of. Most people are stuck in a
consumer lifestyle, where all they can do is lie a thousand steps behind, sucking
the last drops out of what was new ten years ago.

I think schools are full of brilliant people who are just waiting for a kick
to start building great things. I think they need time, a place, money, but
most of all they need support: intellectual support (to be able to try your ideas
against other minds), moral support (to fight against depressive tendencies - a
common trait among innovators), financial support, legal advice, etc. etc.

### the bootstrap

This is why I have created [the bootstrap](http://thebootstrap.ch/).

The bootstrap is a support net for self-driven people in Switzerland.
It started out of a discussion around beers between a group of people, in the
aftermath of Startup Week-end Lausanne.

Every time you meet up with dynamic people, it encourages you to take a few
steps further. If I didn't have a core group of friends who believe in me and
support me, I wouldn't have spent 16 hours hacking together a website to
further our informal meetings.

In the long term, I would like to be able to provide other forms of support
besides intellectual and moral: with time and by involving the right people,
I hope to set up a space for those people to hang out, but also sit down
and build their ideas into real-world products and services.

All these material commodities will be welcome whenever they arrive, but
in the meantime, the first most important step is this: to convince a certain
type of people that they can either work their whole life to get a high score
at a game they can't win, or to knock over expectations and create their own
game, play by their own rules.

The revolution will not come from the streets with noisy slogans and flashy
parades. Destroying alone will not be enough: the ones who will truly rule
the world of tomorrow are the one who choose to build it, step by step,
with respect, consciousness, and dedication.
