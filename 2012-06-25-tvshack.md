Richard O'Dwyer was the man behind TVShack.net.
The thing is, he's not been real smart about it.

That's not exactly honorable of him. But the US is in the process
of extrading him from the UK to be judged, and that's now how the
law is supposed to work.

Jimmy Wales recently started an [online petition to stop his extradition](http://www.change.org/petitions/ukhomeoffice-stop-the-extradition-of-richard-o-dwyer-to-the-usa-saverichard).
Interviewed by the Huffington Post, he said:

I don't condone what Richard did, and the path we've chosen is
harder, but I think it's for the best. However, I believe that it
is worth standing strong against such threats to the rights of
non-US citizens.
