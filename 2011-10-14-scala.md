### Wait, really? But I thought you hated everyone?

Well, I am not overly fond of its syntax and all, but overall I can
pretty much knock myself out writing beautiful Scala code. So I guess
that is a good sign.

### What has got you boiling then?

[Two](https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_9_1_final/src//library/scala/io/Source.scala#L244) [things](https://lampsvn.epfl.ch/trac/scala/browser/scala/tags/R_2_9_1_final/src//library/scala/io/Position.scala#L1).

Go on, read them, I will wait.

### Okay, you got me, what is wrong with that code?

So, so many things are wrong that I do not even know where to begin.

As a preface, remember that Scala is a language that comes from LAMP,
one of the prestigious labs of [EPFL](http://epfl.ch/), that has trouble
holding up to their promise that a multi-paradigm yet orthogonal, etc.
language would make better software easier to produce.

And yet here is what we find in this code:

  * It starts in an invalid state. Yes, column and line are initialized
  with 1 and 1 (which is correct), but pos is initialized to 0. Which
  **would be correct** if pos represented something sane, such as byte
  offset in the file, but no! Because...
  * ...they actually pack the line and column in a single 32-bit integer,
  by some clever bit-shifting and bit-masking. Yes, in Scala. Which, all
  things considered, is not that smart because...
  * ...saving 32 bits per Source file you read (the Source object itself
  probably takes a few dozens of bytes) on a VM that takes hundreds of
  megabytes to even boot is ridiculous. Additionally...
  * ...the code silently fails if you have more than 2^20 lines, or more
  than 2^10 columns. (Laughing? I would not be surprised to find code
  generators outputting no newlines and files upwards of 1KB)
  * It assumes all tabs are 4 chars wide. You can adjust that, of course.
  Good luck finding the real column with anything except tabinc=1, though.
  * io.Position.pos is not the current position, but the position of the
  character next last returned. It is documented, but still wtf
  * Since they are abusing Int, you can still do stuff like pos + 1, but
  it makes no sense whatsoever - again, it will silently fail and pretty
  much decode to a random line/column.

All of this to.. avoid storing two integers.

### Conclusion

Writing smart code is not clever.

The code above is not only unsafe, confusing, hard to read and difficult
to maintain, it also has a long history of bugs (some of which are still
present in Source).
