### Factoids

Today is October 30th, 2012.

Disney just bought LucasArts for 4 billion dollars. They've announced Star
Wars Episode 7 for 2015, and plan to release a Star Wars feature every 2-3 years.

Doom was first released in 1993. OpenGL 1.0 was released in 1992. Quake III's fast
inverse square root has been irrelevant for at least 10 years on modern hardware.
IPX as a viable LAN option for games disappeared sometimes around 1995.

Sega's last mainstream game system, the Dreamcast, was released in 1998,
and discontinued in 2002. The last good Sonic the Hedgehog game was released in
1996.

Rage Against the Machine disbanded in 2000. (And no, the reunion doesn't
count). DC Talk disbanded in 2001. Green Day's last good album dates back to
2003. 

The last good game of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater franchise was THPS 2 (2000, by
Neversoft, probably their last good game. All that followed was THPS rehashes and
Guitar Hero games). The last good game of the Heroes franchise was Heroes of
Might and Magic III (I've wasted EUR50 on the DRM-riddled Heroes VI - don't buy it.)

Rare Ltd., developers of Donkey Kong Country & Conker's Bad Fur Day, died on
September 24, 2002 when it was acquired by Microsoft. Since then, they put out
shit like 'Kinect Sports'.

Super Mario Brothers 3 came out in 1988. Starcraft, the original, came out in 1998.

### Take-away

It's weird to feel old at 22 - and weirder that the feeling has been persistent
for years already. But I understand what's been plaguing me: I'm culturally stuck
in the past, and I don't identify with whatever comes out these days.

Sure, there's the Binding of Isaacs and the Vessels. The Toadies and the Dillons.
But I'm not alone in feeling that the fastfood taste of new game and music releases
is unsavory. How else can you explain the success of the Angry Video Game Nerd?
Of the renewed 2D indie game scene?

In the past, I've written a [pretty extreme article](http://amos.me/blog/2012/fear/), for which
I've gotten (deserved) flak for mentioning Nuremberg. Okay, you can't compare ethnic
cleansings and cultural crimes, but that's missing the point.

I get that some people don't give a shit about their cultural roots, but I do.
When I say that, as children, we've absorbed the movies, shows, music that we grew
up with, I mean it. That they're now part of our "collective conscience". I'm not
a fan of mass culture in general, but (even taking into consideration the "memories
make the past look better than it was") mass culture was better then. And saying
that makes me an old chap.

Well, I don't give a fuck. I'm old, so be it. I'll stop the rambling here and
go back to my zsnes and Gens.
