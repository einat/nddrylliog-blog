### Translation

How long will they keep at it?

Legacy economic actors cover themselves in ridicule while defending their turf,
and like all shopkeepers, those of the printed press, of the record industry, of
industrial patents, and others, copyright crazies recently made a request to the
already-unpopular French government to do their bidding by racketeering the peaceful
population and their competitors, all for their own private interests.

Got a problem? Business not so good anymore? It's simple. Just lobby your
government to increase your "enemies"' taxes.

It's already hard enough to imagine a future on the remnants of an arguably
selfish and careless past, without having to endure the subsidy demands of
agonising mammoths.

**Reinvent! React, and we will be brothers in arms, we will help you adapt.**

Keep cracking the whip, and you will make enemies out of us.

It's only logical that trying to increase the revenue streams of supposed
rightsholder will foster justified anger. **I'm ready to pay more taxe to save
the public service, schools and hospitals, not for the "sons of" or the oblivious
press barons.**

The copyright mafia intends, for example, to increase taxes on storage devices,
explaining that one of their main use cases is to store copyrighted products.

Make up your mind, dearies. Either leave it all open and tax mass media storage
or fully embrace the hadopian(1) hell of your dreams, and then mass media
storage is considered *pure* - in which case, we don't want to hear about any
taxes.

(1) [HADOPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law) is French law and anti-piracy organism.

You know, it's funny because, because I have exactly *zero* illegally acquired
works on my hard disks. So, I'm paying for a few tracks, and then I should pay
again just to keep a copy at home?

It gets worse. I own several large hard drives, because I produce videos, music,
all outside of your distribution channels - and I'm proud of it (like many
others), and then I need to pay so that your 'copyright heirs' get their share?
Truth is, you're just. Too. Good.

Yes, heirs. Yes, "sons of".

Let's talk about rightsholders.

The fact that artists' children can live for 70 years on the rights of their
parents' work seem completely immoral to me. Copyright heirs are the
product of aristocratic tendencies. Those are shameful privileges. Did they not
get enough money from their parents' will? Can't they work like everyone else?

In spite of what we are continuously being told, I think Art doesn't need
managers. It would be a beautiful thing to see children dedicating their lives
to promote the work of their parents, if their works had fallen into the public
domain, not if it's only to yield profit! If the works of Claude François or
Jacques Brel fell along with this posthumous industry, it would mean that their
songs weren't fit to transcend generations. But I am personally convinced
otherwise: Brel's works in the public domain would have persisted just as well.
And, let's be honest, the same applies to Claude François.

By the way, here's a bright idea I just had. Since we all agree that these
debates have, obviously, one and the same objective - the greatness and support
of Art itself, let's get started on a prodigious adventure: how about giving 
basic income(2) to artists? Let's make it even more comfortable: a monthly,
unconditional 2000 EUR. Survival is ensured, money is not a worry anymore, all
that's left is Art.

(2) In French: revenu de base / revenu universel.

You'll see. Music stores will see a revival... in quality.
