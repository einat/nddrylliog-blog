### What is hub anyway?

[hub](http://defunkt.io/hub/) teaches git about GitHub. Ie instead of doing stuff like

    git clone git@github.com:nddrylliog/blog.git

You can do stuff like

    hub clone -p blog

(If you are me - the `-p` is for private)

Or stuff like

    hub clone fredreichbier/deadlogger

And that is not all! There is plenty of stuff hub can do for you. So go check it out, because
it is quite simply awesomesauce. Of course we are not going to cover it all, just the clone part.

### Wait. So you are advocating it?

Well, kinda. As @defunkt mentions, everytime you run hub, you get hit by the Ruby VM startup
time (which is not so bad once it is all in cache, but still). If you install it via rubygems,
it gets even worse. And if you alias git to hub, then you no longer have a fast version around.

Not that I care, though, because I have all the high-end hardware I can get! However, I constantly
find myself running around from server to server, and not all of them have hub pre-installed.

Sure, I could just turn around and yell at my sysadmin, but in the meantime here is this little
thing to reduce the pain. But for that, we need to understand a bit more about the git-clone above.

### Okay, so how does this git clone work?

Well, you may know that there are several ways to access a git repo. One of them is by https://,
another is the git:// protocol, and GitHub seems to be overly fond of the ssh variant.

SSH is this wonderful things that allows you not only to securely open remote shells on servers,
but also copy files from them (scp), mount whole remote folders (sshfs), and probably lots of
other stuff but actually we are good with that.

When copying files from an ssh server, we do stuff like

    scp user@server:path/to/the/file local/path

And when copying to it, we just reverse the arguments! It is a simple as that.

So, when we are cloning a git repository by doing:

    git clone git@github.com:nddrylliog/blog.git

We are actually passing a remote ssh path, with user `git`, on server `github.com`, found
at `nddrylliog/blog.git`. Wait - you might be thinking - does that mean everyone is actually
the same user on GitHub? Well, when accessing repos by SSH on GitHub, you are identified by
your SSH key, that you can upload in `User settings`. And that is all they need to know about you.

Now ssh, as every power-user tool is configurable. There is little file in ~/.ssh/config
that allows you to specify stuff like aliases, and primary users per server. And there
comes our tiny everyday-life-improvement

    Host g
        HostName github.com
        User git

And ta-daa! We can now do this:

    git clone g:nddrylliog/blog.git

And it turns out the `.git` is not even necessary (do they have symlinks? a virtual fs that
resolves that? I do not really want to know), so you can do:

    git clone g:nddrylliog/blog

And that my friend, just saved you 17 strokes per clone.

I would like to thanks [@quinnirill](https://twitter.com/quinnirill) for actually giving
me the idea to use `g` for `github.com`, and myself for taking the time to write an article on it.
