### Intro

I used to think San Francisco-based company BitTorrent, Inc. was fighting
the good fight. After all, they're one of the few that took peer-to-peer
from an academic research subject to a mainstream transmission protocol.

According to [Wikipedia][wp], BitTorrent had 150M active users in Jan. 2012,
200K of which have been sued for copyright infringement since 2010. So,
success in terms of userbase at least.

What about the business itself? Well, BitTorrent Inc. has been up since
2004, and grew to be 60 employees big in 2011. They have worked out deals
with artists and other companies to promote the legit usage of the
BitTorrent protocol.

For example, the band Counting Crows has released its album [Underwater Sunshine][cc]
via BitTorrent (it was even featured on [bittorrent.com][bt]). BT Inc. also
has ties with movie distributor [VODO][vodo], which touts about 15 petabytes
of free - independant - movies shared via the BitTorrent protocol.

### uTorrent

Enter uTorrent (mu for the pedantic - but I'll stick to ASCII kthx). Born
out of the frustration with Bloatware, uTorrent was first created by
[Ludvig Strigeus][ludv] in an attempt to come up with a lean torrent client.

After a small flirt with PeerFactor (interestingly, founded by a former
employee of a French anti-piracy organization), it was acquired just one
and a half year after the 1.1 beta release.

Throughout its lifetime at BT Inc., uTorrent grew [from a mere 154KB to
a whopping 875KB][utsize] - along with its users discontent with the
bloat added version after version.

Recently though, BT Inc. announced that it was going [one step further][osf]:
uTorrent is now going to be ad-supported. Sponsored torrents, in-client ads,
the whole shebang.

### Does this mean surrender?

And to think things were looking so bright! [BitTorrent live][btlive] - although
closed, was an ambitious project which should have disrupted live broadcasting.
What happened instead? Almost no press post-release, it seems they are playing
quiet... and now this announcement.

I've [criticized ad-based models][ads] in the past, and I intend to keep criticizing
it until I die trying to come up with something else. Partnering up with artists and
doing high-profile releases was really promising, and I hate to see BT Inc. taking
this direction.

If even the mothership loses its way, who's going to fight the good fight?
