### Intro

My [previous thoughts](http://amos.me/blog/2012/movies/) about movie distribution have left
me hungry for more. The website has gone its usual way, improving features (similar movies,
search results), receiving requests to "buy our traffic" (declined, as usual), and considering
partnerships, which we eventually decided not to go for.

But I've come to a crossroads: according to pretty much everyone, movies.io is the best thing
since sliced bread. Well, except for the occasional wrong listing. A guy on Facebook even
told us that it "changed his life", thanking us for the amount of work we put in it.

Well, that's all good and fancy, but where do we go from here? What's the big vision there?
That's what prompted me to spend a few more weeks thinking hard about the future. I don't have
all the answers yet, but I'm happy to say that I was able to come up with a few principles.

### DRM & licensing woes

One of the hard decisions to make was to collaborate with a new distribution platform. However,
there was the issue of [DRM][drm]. Digital Rights Managements is an umbrella term for a series of
techniques to restrict what customers can do with the content they pay for.

[drm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management

For example, if they rent a movie, they shouldn't be able to keep it after the 48h/72h they're
given to watch it. If they buy a movie, they shouldn't be able to make copies for their friends,
nor should they be able to sample the movie in their own creations.

In the relatively short history of DRM, we've seen mostly failures. DVDs, not happy with being
region-specific, and thus having region-specific players, in order to enforce windowed releases
and limit cross-country leaks, have a DRM mechanism called [CSS][css] (Content Scrambling System). The
basic idea is to hide a cryptographic key of 16 bits in the lead-in area of a DVD, not readable
by a standard DVD drive, that is used to decrypt the rest of the DVD.

[css]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Scramble_System

Unfortunately for them, it was quickly reverse-engineered, as it was extremely susceptible to
brute force (which is not a surprise considering the size of the key). The de-scrambling code
has since been distributed as an easy-to-use library named libdvdcss, whose legality in certain
countries (the United States, for example) [is still being discussed][liblegal], although no action seems
to have been taken against its users.

Seasons came and went, and the Blu-ray standard was released, along with its own flavor of DRM,
[AACS][aacs], supposedly stronger than its younger brother. However, it was quickly defeated as well,
by inspecting the memory of running Blu-ray and HDDVD players. The encryption keys were found,
and using the public specs, an open decryption software was released. And once again, people were
able to make backups of the movies they had licensed.

Notice how I said "licensed" above instead of "bought"? Well, that's because buying a movie is
an entirely different story. In fact, distribution companies have a job position named "movie buyer".
Theatres, streaming services, all have film buyers so that they can license the rights to show the film,
make profit out of it, and give back part of them so that everybody is happy.

When you're a regular movie fan, however, that's a completely different story. When you buy a song
on iTunes, or a game on Steam, you don't own it. You merely have acquired the rights to play it for your
own entertainment and god forbid should you share any of that to the outer world. For subscription-based
services, it's even easier: cancel your subscription, and you lose access to the wide catalog you once
could enjoy.

Buying the rights to distribute a movie is extremely difficult. Your best assets, sales agents, are
also your worst enemies. First, you need a certain critical mass so that they will even agree to talk
to you. Then they'll want to know if your platform is "safe" - codeword for "yo dude, got DRM?". Then
they'll ask what rights you want: do you want to rent/sell digital copies (DVDs, Blu-rays), do you want
to stream them over the internet? Do you want people to be able to download them? And so on.

You'd think that in 2012, there would be some kind of licensing platforms where you can go fish for
the rights to distribute such and such movies. Alas, that is but a sweet dream. Even if you'd get all
the major studios (there are 5 of them, who own over 95% of the american media, themselves owned
by ever bigger conglomerates) on board - and Cthulhu knows they love to collaborates - such a platform
would make it harder to play a game they like very much.

And that game is guerilla tactics to try and squeeze as much profit from a single movie as possible.
So, let's say you want to license a relatively popular movie. If you manage to find out who's selling it,
you'll have to pick your phone. (Yes, your phone. In 2012. But let's carry on.) Then you'll have to
reassure them about all the points above. And then when they finally decide that you're of some interest,
they'll maybe give you the rights for, say, North America and Latin America. Then later on, as you are
about to release the movie on your platform, they'll call back and say "Actually, you can't have North
America - latin America is all you get.". And you can yell and stomp and raise your fist, it isn't going
to change their mind.

This complicated, mindnumbing, and antiquated process, is the reason why it's still easier for [Redbox][redbox]
to rent physical items than to do online streaming. In 2012. It's also the reason why so many movies are
available on DVD and Blu-ray via [Netflix][netflix], but they only have 2 to 4-week windows where they're
available on Instant. It's also the reason [Mubi][mubi] only has the German dub for Reservoir Dogs available
in Switzerland, and not the original version. The list goes on and on.

### Doing things differently

The only mainstrea exception, as I see it, is [Vodo][vodo]. They use BitTorrent to freely release movies
and TV features such as [Deadside][deadside], up to 720p. Then, they let users donate to get access to the
1080p version, and exclusive items such as the original script, posters, original soundtracks, access codes
to gift to their friends, and so on.

Vodo's blinding lack of DRM is perhaps best embodied by their mantra, which resonates at the beginning of
their every videos: "We love free". While this is a laudable philosophy, it seems to yield lesser profits
than expected, despite partnerships with BitTorrent Inc., and pretty much every other BitTorrent-related
company on earth. Some content creators even left with a bitter taste, yielding [a rant on indie distribution][rant],
complete with their own portable movie projector design.

So, in short, I admire what Vodo is doing, but it doesn't seem to be working up to their expectations.
It's also limited in terms of usefulness to the content creator, because it handles only the distribution part.
What I have in mind for movies.io is much bigger.

The bet that we're both taking is that you can find talented content creators willing to publish their work
on a DRM-free platform, and still allow them and yourself to make a comfortable living. I'm glad they paved
the way, because this is definitely the direction I'm taking.

If you spend a few weeks reading advice for indie filmmakers on blogs and specialized websites, you'll realize
that it's a jungle out there. So many pitfalls to avoid, so many ill-intentioned people just waiting to exploit
you. So many hardships, between costs, rights, location, casting, post-production, distribution.

And then there's YouTube. A strange mix of copyrighted content, tolerated by the big five presumably because
they own shares of it, and original content, often terrible, but sometimes brilliant. In the past 10 years
(even before YouTube), we've seen content creators harness the power of the internet, and bathe in its culture,
in order to create original content that appeals to millions. CollegeHumor, founded in 1999, grew to $15 million
yearly profits before [being acquired by InterActiveCorp][chbuyout].

Of course, YouTube's monetization scheme is far from my ideals. As I mentioned before, I have a heavy bias
against advertisements - yet, for most YouTubers, advertisements are the primary revenue stream. Some even
sell out to big brands and make them a central part of their show. So, in a way, YouTube truly is television,
except you get a virtually infinite supply of channels, and profanity is not censored. It's more democratic
because there's no conglomerate deciding what gets aired, but it's also what makes it so demaguogue and
volatile.

What I think is needed, is a platform designed from the ground up to immediately cater to the needs of content
creators. From pre-casting (browsing people's profiles), to continuous fundraising, to community management,
distribution, and licensing. The only part completely left out would be production - that should be the exclusive
responsibility of the content creators. Of course, the other parts are pretty much DIY tools as well, with
some advice and opportunity to discuss various hurdles with more seasoned creators.

### From here to there

The problem is, building something that big is very ambitious, and you have to start somewhere. movies.io
currently has between 6K and 10K daily visitors, so that's a good base to build from.

I had a few thoughts about how I want to do this. I want to be transparent in its operation: in my opinion,
it shouldn't prevent an honest business from running correctly. In particular, it should avoid censorship
(unlike, indirectly, the MPAA ratings board).

I also have strong feelings that most distribution companies consider that the United States is the only
country of the world. Believe it or not, this is not actually true. There are many different countries, with
different cultures, languages, and more importantly, with different sensibilities. In my way of running things,
I want these different sensibilities to be acknowledged, and imported as a part of how the website works.

The first step is to translate the movies.io interface in different languages. The i18n system is in the works,
and we'll start accepting translators very soon. I've also picked up language learning where I left off, so that
I can better understand the different sensibilities I discussed earlier: English and français are pretty much
dealt with, so I've started re-learning deutsch, español, и русский.

The second step is to find people of all cultures whose passion for video content in general knows no bound,
and whose awareness of the cultural context and trends is evident. I think that working with people from various
horizons will help me widen my perspective on the platform itself.

Thirdly, I'd like to tackle not only movies but series, shows, lives, and comedy as well. From the user feedback
we get, they'd use the movies.io interface for everything if they could. So why the hell not?

The next few steps will require a lot of work, finding the right partners, and of course, figuring the legal and
technical infrastructure to sustain such a business. But that's alright - I'm in it for the long run. While competition
seems to make matters pressing, I'm not in a hurry.
