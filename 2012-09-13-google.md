### Creating Sitemaps

On Google's help center about sitemap creation, we find this gem:

> Google can accept Web Sitemaps in a number of formats, but we
> recommend creating a Sitemap based on the Sitemap protocol
> because the same file can be submitted to the other search
> engines, such as Bing and Yahoo!, that are members of sitemaps.org.

However obvious, this little paragraph is mind-blowing to me.

Bing and Yahoo! although feeble, are direct competitors to Google,
the search engine. Of course, their main revenue stream is advertisement,
but without the ubiquitous search engine, they'd be nowhere.

And yet in this help center, all they care about is standards, and
interoperability. How beautiful.
