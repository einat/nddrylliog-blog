I think this is called taking the plunge :)

The release of [movies.io](http://movies.io) has marked the beginning of a series of
events all crazier than the previous one.

First, Frederic Jacobs pushed me to deploy it for all to see, whereas it was
originally a gift for my girlfriend. Then we made, in the same week, the front
page of Hacker News, gathering more than 500 points and 400 comments,
TorrentFreak, and then a dozen articles on American, Spanish, Chilean, Norwegian
news websites. At the time of this writing, we have served over 900,000 pages,
for 17,500 movies and 5,600 registered users.

The response has been overwhelmingly positive: we received a ton of fan mail,
and we've even started receiving donations! People love the design, and they
think we come at a time where there is really something to do in video
distribution. Well, the good news is that we think so too!

Fred and I have decided to bite the bullet and go fulltime. We have a team of
dedicated and talented people behind us, and are looking forward to move fast
and disrupt the world of video distribution. While we are still working out the
details, we already have a few good leads in the independent film industry. If
you would like to be part of the adventure, drop us an e-mail at
<admin@movies.io>!

There really are no words to describe how I'm feeling right now, but it seems
that everything up to this point has been leading up to that. I'd like to thank
warmly Jeremie Abissihra and Ben Colon, who provided me with guidance and
countless opportunities during my time at [official.fm](http://official.fm). It was a
wonderful experience and if I had to do it again, I would. Huge thanks also to
my loving girlfriend, close friends, [the bootstrap](http://thebootstrap.ch) supporters, and
Twitter followers for all the support. It really means a lot.

As of now, entrepreneurship is no longer a buzzword, but my day-to-day. May it
be for the best!

If you want to send me a word or two, don't hesitate to hit me up at my new
e-mail address: <amos@movies.io>.
