### So, you just received a job offer...

You're a brilliant chap, you've published or have contributed to a few open-source
projects. You tweet and retweet interesting things, and you may even have a portfolio
up somewhere, or a blog.

And then, out of the blue, you've received an e-mail from a guy you don't know. It's
about a job offer. His company is looking for young talents, and is presented in a
very favorable light.

Congrats!

However, here are a few things to keep in mind.

### Recruiters are not your friend

As true as [VCs are not your friends][vcs], recruiters are not your friends either.
In their eyes, you are meat. Tender, delicate, fresh meat, but still meat. We are
talking about the brand people able to put hundreds of employees out of their jobs
because it helps maximizes profits.

If you're still having doubts about this, read [The Rise of Developeronomics][douches],
published in Forbes, one of the world's largest business magazine. While some business
people have more of a human side than others, they're definitely not doing you a favor:
they're trying very hard to find competent people, and that's their job.

### Don't wet yourself

Having someone hitting on you is very flattering. Use it as an ego boost without
hesitation. But, for humanity's sake, don't lose your shit. You are in demand here,
which means you get to play 'hard to get'. That's right.

Finding good developers is a daunting task. Companies spend a great deal of money paying
other companies to do the scouting for them, most of the time with little success. The
smartest in the bunch put out challenges for curious hackers to get hooked on.

But all in all, recruitment is still a game of hit and miss. A good recruiter will have
done an essential deal of homework on you: reviewing your main skills, notable open-source
contributions, studies, etc. But don't kid yourself: he's probably not obsessing over you.

Realizing that the person asking on you is simultaneously asking out dozens of other
folks right now should calm you down a little. Avoid being too excited, too verbose, or
too praisy in your response. Stay polite, short, and efficient. They'll appreciate it, too.

### Don't put out until third date

Relationships in a company evolve. When you're at the "potential hire" stage, your
relationship with the company is a seduction game in which both parties should still be
cautious as to where they're stepping.

If you're a nice guy, always looking to help find consensus and knowing how to let others
be right when it matters, then awesome! That will get really useful later on in the
company. But for the interview and negotiation phases, you really don't want to let that
out too much.

Whoever is interviewing you is paid to employ the company's resources as efficiently as
possible. If it means paying you 20K less because you're too kind to ask for more, they
will do it. The initial impression you give (ie. the first e-mail response) will be the
recruiter's base for his negotiation game. Don't give him an unfair edge.

### Think twice before making a decision

If you are really good, chances are you will get other offers. Don't abandon your studies
lightly. If you can combine school and a job, awesome! Just make sure you don't burn out.
Don't commit for life to a company, think bigger.

Do you have start-up ambitions of your own? Sure, a job means month ends are less stressful,
but the fact of the matter is that you'll be working towards someone else's dream. It can
be a valuable piece of experience, but it's not your baby. Choose your priorities.

Just because you say "no thanks" doesn't mean you can't stay in contact with the dudes.
Building a network of your own never hurts, whatever your career ends up looking like.

### Smile!

You should feel good about yourself. A good job offer is a good indicator that you have
a bright future ahead of you, regardless of your decision.

And now, good luck!
