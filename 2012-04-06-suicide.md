### Switzerland

In a recent popular vote, the Swiss people decided against passing from four
mandatory weeks of holidays per year to six. Everywhere in the world, the white
cross on a red background is a symbol of hard work, reliability, efficiency,
and professionalism.

Switzerland has been successfully flipping off its neighbors, by sticking with
its own currency and only contracting bilateral agreements when it wants to,
on its own terms. A luxury that not many countries on this side of the ocean
can afford.

It also happens to be the country with the highest suicide rate in western Europe.
In 2007 alone, more than 1360 men and women decided to end their life. Around
25% of those suicides were committed using firearms, a remarkably high
figure on the old continent.

Unsurprisingly, nobody on the little white island seems particularly eager to
share this with you.

### Silence

As an active contributor of [/r/SuicideWatch](http://reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch) from 2008 to 2011,
and human who visited several friends in hospitals or mental institutions, I feel
entitled to talk about this subject.

If I have learned anything in these past five years, it's this: suicide is silent.
Attention-seeking is a sign of life! Drama is okay! Anything that carries you on
to the next day is fine in my book.

Suicide is not an impulse. It's a long process, an infection that develops in your
mind. You never really get rid of it, you just learn to work around it. It's a day-to-day
combat. There is no cure for suicide, only treatment.

In the same way that [drowning doesn't look like drowning](http://gcaptain.com/drowning/?10981), suicidal people
don't look suicidal. Popular culture is notoriously bad at depicting either.

### Smoke and mirrors

No direct causes have been established that reliably allow to predict suicidal
tendencies. Suicide does not happen overnight. It appears into one's mind as a
potential ultimate solution.

The loss of a loved one, of a job, debt, harassment, physical disease can all
provoke suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, none of that is needed. Depression alone
can foster such inclinations, without anyone being able to come up with a
reason.

As depression develops, self-confidence fades away, and psychological isolation
prevents you from trying to seek help elsewhere. A different thought system
emerges: others could not understand. How many times have these word come out
of a teenager's mouth or keyboard?

Attention-seeking is actually a good sign. Drama is great! It's great because
it's a sign of life. That perhaps someone is looking for help, or simply trying
to feel alive. Cutting is not healthy nor sanitary, but when you are deep into
depression, doubting your own existence, it is a common resort to wake up.

I do not encourage self-hurt at all, but it is a fantastic indicator and should
not be under-valued. *Not everyone has that chance*. Completely silent suicides
occur as well, fully grown inside a diseased and helpless mind. Physical wounds
can be healed pretty well, but once someone has ended their existence, it's too
late to do anything about it.

The last stage of suicidal tendencies is the sneakiest. When someone has decided
that they are going to end it, they enter a phase of peacefulness. They have
finally something to look forward to. They plan the mean, the date. They exercise.

They'll try to put their life in order. To resolve conflicts, ask for forgiveness.
To thank people for what they've done, and being who they are. To see some people
one last time. From the outside, it looks like they're living again! Like they've
snapped out of it.

### Survival

Life is brutal. Everyone is lying. Being tagged as suicidal brings you through
a world of shit, especially in Switzerland where it is so instutitionalized.
Would you give a job to a suicidal person? Grant a loan? Let them drive your
kids to school? ...exactly.

The road is long and it is tough. The only choice left is to lie your way through
the years, and only confide yourself whenever you find someone that you can
trust enough not to stab you in the back. And these people are not always easy
to find.

Suicide is everywhere, it's in your neighborhood, at your office, in your family.
Hiding the problem is only making it worse. Please pay attention to the people
around you: try to understand what they are going through, don't take over their
life, but just be there for them.

Suicide is contagious. Living for years with someone going through depressive
phases can and will get to you. Protect yourself before doing anything else.
When things just go over your head, seek professional help. Call a suicide hotline.
Find a support group.

### Stance

I like to make people feel uncomfortable. Getting to really know someone includes
discussing suicide, sexuality, and other subjects. Because for me, they are
the quickest way to know what someone is made of.

Between someone who always had it easy, and someone who is struggling every single
day, who is the strongest? Between someone too dumb to question anything around
them, and someone who is at loss for answers but decides daily to just carry on
any way they can, who is the most alive?

People who came back from the dark side (to varying degrees) truly know the
value of life. The same goes for alcohol, drugs, or any addiction: it takes more
guts to quit than to never start. Playing with death is a life experience: it 
gives an additional dimension to your days.

Who the fuck cares about whatever just happened? I'm alive, and you are too!
It's a wonderful day to do anything at all.

Choose life. Then live the fuck out of it.
