### About playing games

There's this whole fad lately about "playing games".

Right now, it might seem like a cool thing to do. If you've been developing
games for a while, it might be tempting to go through the looking glass and
see the other side of things. After all, you've been making these things for
years, so you should be good at playing them, right?

Well, hold on. It might not be as fancy as you think.

First off, know that the first game you play might not be great. You
might be swayed by some big studio, AAA game that you can actually finish
in under 20 hours, has poor replayability, and will generally leave you
disappointed and ashamed that you spent upwards of 40EUR on it.

But wait, there's still hope: apparently there's been a whole scene
developing lately: the "indie" movement, games made by small teams, on a
tight budget, and made out of love and nostalgia for the old-fashioned,
SNES games that you might have dabbled with during your youth.

Be careful though, because the perils just keep piling on. Although
some truly remarkable gems hide in the indie scene, you're bound to experience
[Sturgeon's Law][sl] the hard way. Trusting your friends' recommendations
is no good either: something that works very well for them might not work
for you.

It gets worse. You know how when you're doing a game, you have complete
control over the storyline, you can integrate new gameplay elements at will,
and fix everything that annoys you? Well truth is, most games are closed-source,
and not updated often. They're just released, and then - good luck! You're
on your own. If you want to do more than just customize the color of your hat,
you're not the target demographic.

In fact, playing games feels more like eating a cake than baking! If you
play too much, you get full, and then there's nothingt to do but wait until
you can take some more.

It doesn't stop there. If you're in game development, you're used to being
able to automate actions. If a process feels repetitive, you'll write some
piece of code that does it for you. If you see opportunity for abstraction,
you'll come up with a framework that allows you to see things from a
high-level perspective, and save yourself some time.

In actual games? Not so much. Be you playing RPGs, MMORPGs, strategy games,
simulation games, or action games, you'll quickly realize that most of the
times, the game is designed such that it constrains yourself to re-use the
same basic mechanisms over and over again, mindlessly.

You might be thinking playing games is a great way to get rid of all that
extra money. Be advised though, that it may not be the case. Indie games
are generally priced low, and sales season will simply ruin your spending
plans, leaving you with too much money. If you're thinking of using games
as a primary way to spend your extra bucks, think again - you might not
want to give up food at first.

So here is a heartfelt warning to everyone in the game industry who's thinking 
about trying to get into the "playing games" fad: it's not for everyone.

Seriously.

### Epilogue

This post is a - slightly - disguised parody of a post that's been making
the rounds lately: [What They Don't Tell You About Being a Game Developer][wtt].

[wtt]: http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/11/21/what-they-dont-tell-you-about-being-a-game-developer/

So, do I disagree completely with the article? Not really. But I would say
that it is missing the point to some extent.

To me, becoming an indie game developer is turning a passion into a business.
When you're looking into business ideas, the first things that comes to mind
is usually not: "Oh, I know! I'll bake cakes and sell them! I've seen someone
do it once and it didn't look too hard. Plus, have you seen how many of those
sell in stores?"

No. If you do make a living selling cakes you bake yourself, it's because
you're damn good at it, and your cakes are unique. You've been doing it for
a while before even thinking of selling them, and you enjoy the process of
making a cake, even outside of the business/money-making part.

So that would be my first two pieces of advice: **don't do it for money**,
and **make sure you find pleasure in the journey itself**.

Here's another important piece of advice: **don't sell your first game**.
Don't be fooled and think the idea you have now is the greatest you will
ever have and that it would be a pity to give it away. Creativity works
in [mysterious ways](mkth).

Instead, **enter game jams** to make your first few games. There are plenty
of good, honest-to-god game creation events around: [Ludum Dare][ld] is
my favorite, but there's also [Global Game Jam][ggg], [Fuck This Jam][ftj],
and local events like the [Dublin Gamecraft][dgc].

Give yourself some time to fool around with ideas, tools, and find a setup
that's comfortable for you. If you are to carry a full, sellable indie
game to completion, you'll be spending a lot of times with these. So it's
not a waste of time to spend a few week-ends experimenting with each.

Alex talks about negative feedback, and how it can wreck your world. He's
absolutely right. However, if you've been doing open-source for a while,
and have had one of your projects end up on the HackerNews front page for
example, you've been confronted to that.

The best way to deal with negative feedback is:

  - To breathe deeply
  - To acknowledge the fact that your project is unique and not everyone
    will like it.
  - To try and sort out if there is anything constructive to be taken
    from that piece of feedback.
  - To rely on the support from your close ones, and get your mind off of
    it for a while.

That last bullet item brings me to.. my last point. **Who you work with is
the most important thing**. For me, I don't like to work alone anymore. I
find it much easier to stay motivated if I work with at least one or two
other persons.

But working with people that aren't as motivated as you, or that you don't
hold in high esteem (regardless of their actual skills), can only mean
disaster. If you can't find anyone, then maybe it's best to start out alone.
Who knows, you might find collaborators by entering game jams later!

There are many things to be said about team dynamics that won't fit in this
single blog post. If you have a tendency to impress people, you will
have to be careful that the person in front of you just doesn't answer "yes,
amen" because they don't feel like they have a choice, or because thye're
temporarily pumped up by your own motivation aura.

On the contrary, if you're the underselling kind, you might have to learn
and present yourself and your project in a more favorable light. It's hard
to strike a good balance, really.

Personally, I've found that the best dynamics is when every individual in the
team values every other above themselves, and maintain a state of humility
towards the project while being deeply committed to it. That situation fosters
a sane emulation, bringing everybody up at the same time while avoiding the
birth of self-proclaimed rockstars within the team.

### Conclusion

There is truth in some of the horror stories you can read on the Internet
about the game industry, and indie game making in particular. Yes, it's not
necessarily for everyone.

But there are steps you can take to make sure it is for you, just like every
other occupation in the world. So don't freak out, take your time, and
don't trust too much what you read on the internet.
