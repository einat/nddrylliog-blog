### Intro

Watching the success of others can be inspiring, or it can be depressing.
Almost everything looks obvious in retrospect. Especially when the idea has been
fool-proofed and the execution is told as a flawless tale of epicness.

However, success stories are almost always full of lies. They are a necessary
PR step to take a company further, to establish a credibility base. It is usually
not written by the people responsible for that success. Here are a few tips to
keep a realistic mindset when analyzing the success of others.

### Easy is a lie

There is no such thing as an intrinsically easy task. Easy is a lie that hides the
following: pre-existing knowledge, re-enactment of a previous scenario, very
favorable environment, leverage of external resources, abstraction and proper
division of labor between work groups competently chosen.

### Execution is never flawless

Only very few people like to acknowledge what went wrong. Game developers do
post-mortems on Gamasutra. Some artists blog about the hardships they had to go
through to finish a certain piece. Companies don't like to tell you that they
blew deals, had to cut down features, went short on budget.

Shit happens, everywhere. Within companies with good CEOs, they're the ones
taking most of the flak. That's an essential part of their roles: to make sure
that whatever happens, they can continue to provide the best possible environment
for their execution team.

### If it's big, it's not about you

While individuals can build amazing things, beyond a certain scale you need
to work in a team. When you're on top, it's your role to choose people, to
organize them in the structure you think will work best. Your contribution
becomes less direct but still very crucial.

People are a unique kind of resource. You can change offices and still continue
working in the same direction. You can change the name of your company and
still keep making products. But however self-congratulatory you become, don't
think you can change your entire team and keep doing the same thing.

### Outro

You're not the only one going through hard times, it's just that other don't show
it. Practicing is never lost time, you can take advantage of any previous experience
when starting something new. If you're working with a team, they are your most
precious assets, take care of them like it's your own family.
