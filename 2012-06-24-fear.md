I just want to write a few lines on something that has been bothering me for a while.

Since we launched [movies.io](http://movies.io/), I've been running into twenty people
a day who ask me: "Aren't you afraid that you are going to end up in jail?"
Apart from being, you know, a great motivation, it also triggers some thinking.

Of course I'm afraid. The content industry hasn't exactly been known for playing nice,
any party in this industry will tell you that. It's not even about the law, or about
what is fair. It's about protecting interests, even when it goes against human rights,
or the general advancement of humanity.

The [mpaa](http://mpaa.org/contentprotection/roguewebsites) says clearly on its website that it,
together with a broad coalition of businesses, labor unions, guilds, law enforcement,
and other stakeholders, are working on solutions to put a stop to "rogue sites". They
don't hesitate to put TCP packets and untested medicines in the same lot. Or to call
people who exchange information, criminals.

We are warned that, if we choose to disregard intellectual property and consume a piece
of media that we haven't properly acquired or licensed, we should be ready to face the
consequences. It might be that in the current status quo, the big content coalitions
are the ones in power, like some sort of totalitarian regime that can decide what is
right and wrong, and punish wrongdoers. But what is going to happen when that is over?

I'm looking forward to a second [Nuremberg trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Trials).
Where all the people involved in the policing of information exchange will have to answer
for their crimes against humanity. All their partners, copyright enforcement crusaders,
should be judged as accomplices.

Apparently, lying, manufacturing evidence and paying for biased reports is nothing
that they shy away from. What is it, besides propaganda? People are being hired to
chase their fellow human beings and torture them until they give up part of their
belongings for unjust settlements, to avoid a trial.

I think that very few people realize the importance of what is currently happening,
both inside and in periphery of the law, in different countries. Once you start
monitoring and filtering exchanges under the pretense of copyright law, censoring
for other motives entirely is just a switch away. There is much more to it than just
being too cheap to pay for your movies.

This is why, as developer and operator of movies.io, potential public enemy in the
future (depending on our impact on the downloading landscape), I am not worried about
our relationship with big content. I don't think we want any kind of deals with them.
We worry only about the technology, and to serve both content creators and fans.

We still have a lot of work on our plate, but I like to believe that the direction we
pursue is more humane, more compassionate, and more importantly: aimed towards the
global progress of humanity and culture as a whole. If it means that we can't license
Hollywood blockbusters, so be it. I'm getting tired of the formula anyway.

The content industry is fucked up because the people who mass-produce shit to feed
to the majority are very touchy about what you do with what they own. They spend
millions lobbying around telling people how bad downloading is for their economy, and
how it threatens 2.2 million jobs, but at the same time they won't acknowledge that
no matter how bad they treat their target audience, filesharing happens, because it's
such a basic instinct.

The latest wave of cash cow companies since the 2000s have revolved around sharing.
We've seen the rise of social and have yet to see it fall. It's almost ridiculous
how many photo sharing apps and rating apps we have around. And, as is often said,
the best minds of our generations are busy trying to optimize advertisement algorithms
to convert those eyeballs into revenue streams, because apparently that's the only
way to make money in an economy in which people don't want to pay for content anymore.
(The television has worked this way for a much longer time, but that's besides the point).

And yet, the most valuable content: music, videos, remains so very difficult to
exchange in the boundaries established by copyright law. We were able to build a
straight-forward mapping from movies to available torrents in a few days, and it works
remarkably well. In the current situation, nobody can beat our catalogue. Not a single
soul. Why? Because there is no established standard for organizing the licensing rights
of a piece of media. For a single movie, there might be five different rightsholders,
with whom you have to negociate individually, and each of them might not exactly
be sure of how much ownership they have. Try doing a music compilation: it's phone
call upon snail mail upon months of waiting, and in the end you're not even sure
you have the rights you paid for.

The current situation is a clusterfuck, and there doesn't seem to be much incentive
to solve it. The general public is happy to be able to watch music videos on YouTube,
even if they had to give up parts of their shares to big labels to stay in business.
The same happened for Spotify, which, through its Facebook deal, became the de facto
leader in music streaming worldwide. But at which cost? Again, ownership being ripped
off by greedy majors, and deals so tough it's practically impossible to
[become profitable](http://gigaom.com/2011/12/11/why-spotify-can-never-be-profitable-the-secret-demands-of-record-labels/).

I'm not foolish enough to think that we'll ever hit a deal with big content, nor to
think that the current magnet link compromise will last forever. We'll have to evolve
to survive, as does everyone. What needs to happen on a global scale, is a simultaneous
realization, from so-called 'dumb consumers', that the current distribution model
is immoral, and that mass culture provoked it.

Free culture is already thriving in the music area (where starting up is easier because
of lower production costs), and it's slowly gaining ground in the movie area as well.
As far as original content goes, YouTube allowed many small producers to find an
audience, along with a monetization scheme, and I truly respect them for that.

I think we need to take this a step further. The nature of the internet is to be
distributed: it simply feels wrong to depend on a simple gigantic provider to exchange
the culture that makes us humans. Sharing creations is vital to the survival of our
species, it is too important to be left in any single entity's hands.

This article raises more questions than it answers, but we are working towards providing
at least partial solutions. In the meantime, I wanted to state clearly that yes,
fear is part of my daily life, maybe more than before. But I don't want to let it
dictate my actions, because I believe that it would not be for the best.
